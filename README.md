# A Star Pathfinder for Unity

This is an A* Pathfinder for Unity.\n
Can be used to make a cellbased pathfinder or a literal distance pathfinding.


Using the controller to set the start and the end, it will return a list for the shortest path on execution.

Contains an editor to easily make a grid and create the conecctions between nodes.

Use the sample scene AStarTestScene to get the gits of it.

All code should be commented, but if you have any cuestions about it, ask me right away.


So this is my first post in GitHub and I hope you like it.
Thank you very much for any response!
